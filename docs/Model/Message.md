**status** | [**\BulkSMS\Model\MessageStatus**](MessageStatus.md) |  |
**related_sent_message_id** | **string** | This field has a value only if the type is RECEIVED. With SMS messages, it is not possible to link a reply directly with a specific sent message.  However, if you specified &#x60;REPLIABLE&#x60; in the &#x60;from&#x60; property, BulkSMS will link any reply to the most recent message sent to a given phone number.  The &#x60;relatedSentMessageId&#x60; property keeps the information about this link.  You can use this property to derive an implicit conversation from a set of messages.   - If a received reply message has a &#x60;relatedSentMessageId&#x60;, you can use it to retrieve the last message that was sent before the reply was received.   - If you have the &#x60;id&#x60; of the sent message and you want all the received messages that relate to it, you can use the List Related Messages Operation. | [optional]
**user_supplied_id** | **string** | This is the value you supplied in the &#x60;userSuppliedId&#x60; field. Has a value only if the &#x60;type&#x60; is SENT. | [optional]
